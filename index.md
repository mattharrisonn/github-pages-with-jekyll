I'm glad you are here. I plan to talk about ...
* how github is a pain in the ass 
* like, really, a complete mindfuck 
* not as bad as trying to understand git from the command line though 

All that said, I'm quite impressed by my progress. I'm coming at this with absolutely no formal instruction or experience and I just managed to sync up another GitHub repository with my local files, so that's pretty cool tbh!
